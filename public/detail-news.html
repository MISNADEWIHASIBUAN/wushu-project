                        <h4 class="bls p-2 d-flex">2022.08.31 by <div class="card-subtitle ms-2">iwufteam</div></h4>
                        <p>
                            Italy’s newest wushu sensation, Alfonso Barbarisi, comes from Baronissi, a small town in southern Italy. If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is also the home of his coach Michele Giordano, Italy’s most famous wushu star. From his first senior international wushu competition in 2019 World Wushu Championships in Shanghai to the silver medalist at Jianshu & Qiangshu combined event in 2022The World Games in Birmingham, his love of wushu is beyond wining a medal and  he enjoys the continuing experience itself of being an wushu athlete. Now he is preparing the 16th World Wushu Championships in 2023, and his goad is to   rank among the top 8 in the world  to compete at the next Taolu World Cup.

                            Alfonso, now 22, remembers watching a Bruce Lee movie when he was a very little boy and falling in love with kungfu. “For that reason,” he says, “I started with wushu at the age of 4. At the beginning I was very young and it was like a game. But step by step my passion started growing.” His first coach was Bruno Giordano who he trained with until the age of 12, alongside some of Italy’s foremost top champions.

                            “My first competition was when I was 7,” says Alfonso, “and I remember I was very excited. On the carpet I was a little nervous, in front of the judges and people all around watching me. But I knew for sure after that competition that I wanted to practice wushu and improve myself more and more. I saw the Italian wushu scene, and watched the top athletes which gave me a goal to achieve.” Alfonso says that the thing that made him grow the most was having two of the strongest athletes in Italy as coaches, Michele and Domenico Giordano (Bruno Giordano’s sons.)

                            “My first international competition,” recalls Alfonso, “was at the age of 11 at the World Childrens Games in Ankara in 2011. I finished with second place in the qiangshu (spear). I remember that I was really happy, and euphoric to compete and compare myself with guys from other countries with the same passion as me.”


                            <br><br><b class="fs-4">A Champion Emerges</b> <br>
                            

                            As he became a teenager Alfonso started training more intensely with his coach Michele Giordano, who led Italy’s high level wushu team in national and international competition. By 2018 Alfonso was to compete at the European Wushu Championships in Moscow, where he won two silver and two gold medals. He says, “it was great to be a European champion and hear my national anthem on the podium.”

                            This championships qualified Alfonso for the 2019 World Wushu Championships in Shanghai which would vault him to the next level as an athlete. “This experience in Shanghai was really formative,” he says. “It was my first senior international wushu competition, my first time in China, and the competition was full of emotion because I was on the same carpet with the best athletes in the world. They were athletes I had watched only in videos before, and competing with them was an unforgettable experience.”

                            The Shanghai WWC not only offered Alfonso a wondrous wushu experience, but his performance also would ultimately qualify him for the elite 2022 World Games in Birmingham. After suffering through a terrible Covid-19 pandemic, with greatly reduced opportunities for competition, Italian wushu was ready for a win. Alfonso’s three long years of dedication and training since the Shanghai event paid off – and after a fierce battle of talent and determination amidst a field of champions, he emerged victorious as the jianshu and qiangshu combined silver medalist, and the Italian flag rose proudly over the podium in the Bill Battle Coliseum.

                            “The World Games experience was, and will always be, one of the most important experiences of my life,” states Alfonso. “The training was hard, especially the last weeks, but at the same time fun. The journey was tiring because I couldn’t wait to get there and be on the carpet. The competition was full of adrenaline, and I tried to keep my mind clear so as not to make mistakes. The podium, on the other hand, was unexpected — and I really felt a lot of joy in getting on it — but also it created a new determination in knowing and hoping that this is a starting point and not an arrival point.”
